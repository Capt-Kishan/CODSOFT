            <ol>
                <li>
                    Bhagat Singh was born to Vidyavati Kaur and Sardar Kishan Singh, in a Sikh Jat family on 28
                    September 1907
                    at Lyallpur in Punjab Province of British India. His family had earlier been involved in
                    revolutionary activities against the British government.
                </li>

                <li>In 1912, Bhagat joined the District Primary School in Lyallpur and received his elementary education
                    there till class 5th. In 1917, his family shifted to Lahore for his higher education. In Lahore, he
                    was admitted to the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (D.A.V) School, and he received rest of his elementary
                    education from there.</li>

                <li>When he was in the 8th standard, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (13 April 1919) took place. The very
                    next day (on 14 April) he went to the bagh telling at his home that he was going to school. After
                    running about 30 miles from Lahore, Bhagat reached Amritsar. At 2 pm, as Bhagat entered the bagh's
                    compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. </li>

                <li>As it was curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn't been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass
                    bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the
                    bottle. He reached home and put the bottle infront of the Sikh Guru's portrait and prayed to him for
                    peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.</li>
                <li>

                    In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against
                    the British and to boycott their trade in India and to end their cooperation with the British rule.
                    Many people joined the movement and discarded the use of foreign goods and clothes.
                </li>

                <li>Bhagat Singh also actively participated in the movement, he was only 14 years old.</li>

                <li>In 1923, He joined the National College in Lahore. There he studied as well took part in many
                    extracurricular activities. In August 1923, an essay competition was held at the college by Punjab
                    Hindi Sahitya Sammelan. The topic was to write about any of the special acknowledgements about
                    Punjab. Bhagat Singh wrote an essay on the "THE PROBLEM OF PUNJAB'S LANGUAGE AND SCRIPT"</li>

                <li>While studying in National College, he used to spend most of his time in the college library reading
                    books about armed revolution in foreign countries.</li>

                <li>He was inspired by the Russian revolutionaries who believed that armed revolt can only bring
                    freedom. His first act which brought to notice was that occured in March 1924. It is said that one
                    of his friend's bullock cart driver was beaten harshly by some English officials as the sign the
                    outside the office of the officials read - 'Dogs and Indians are not allowed'. He took revenge and
                    along with Sukhdev he attacked the officials car and beated them with lathis (wooden sticks) and
                    escaped unnoticed in the night.</li>

                <li>In April, his father asked him to get married for which he refused. His father pressurised him for
                    it, so one night, he quietly left his home for going to Kanpur. Before leaving he wrote a letter to
                    his father</li>

                <li>In March 1925, he accepted his father's wish returned to Lahore but had to soon escape from there as
                    police had came to know of his whereabouts. He went to Delhi and started publishing the Daily Veer
                    Arjun Newspaper for 6 months.
                    In October, he returned to Kanpur to free the Kakori prisoners who had been arrested after the train
                    robbery in Kakori (9 August) along with their leader Ram Prasad Bismil. The prisoners were
                    temporarily detained at Kanpur police station before being shifted to different central jails across
                    United Provinces.</li>

                <li>On 22 November, along with Azad, Bhagat went to the police station unnoticed and broke the lockups
                    and freed one their comrades but the police soon arrived and they had to run away. Their plan had
                    failed.
                    In March 1926, he organized the Naujawan Bharat Sabha to encourage the young men of his country to
                    fight for there freedom. He began to address big public meetings and asked them to overthrow the
                    British rule in India. He also took the help of dramatics society for the purpose of spreading his
                    message.</li>

                <li>On 23 March at 7:30 pm, the three were hanged till death by the Lahore Central Jail authorities.
                    After hanging, their bodies were carried away secretly to Ferozepore through the backdoor of the
                    jail.
                    Late at night, the authorities reached the Sutlej river banks at Ferozepore where they burnt the
                    bodies of the three revolutionaries.
                    he next day, the people and Kishan Singh cremated the body of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
                    Thus the brave Indian revolutionary laid down his life for liberating his motherland.
                    In the memory of their martyrdom the day 23 March is celebrated every year as 'Martyrs Day'.
